This repository contains all data collected between September 10th and 13th of 
2024 in Lochranza, Arran (Scotland), as part of an Ecological Impact Assessment
conducted to evaluate and compare baseline ecological conditions between two 
study sites (site A and site B), necessary in order to consider potential 
ecological restoration plans for either one of these sites. This EcIA was 
elaborated as part of the course Professional Skills for Ecology and Evolution
belonging to the Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity MSc offered by the
